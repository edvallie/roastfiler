    "description": "We've been sampling a lot of Kenya coffees this year and finding a lot of winners, but this one really stood out because it has a flavor that was familiar but hard to place. Three of us independently from each other came up with Guava as the primary tasting note on it! It's really different, really delicious. This is one to stock up on. We're roasting it about 30 seconds past the end of the 1st cracks, but it's an easier Kenya to roast than most of them are.  You can go a little lighter without it being sour and a little darker without it turning flat. It has a nice acidity, but not as bright of acidity as you might expect. It is SL-28 and SL-34 varietals so you do still get the blackberry and winey notes that I love in a Kenya as well as some lime and the tropical fruit flavors. The brewed coffee sweetens as it cools, so try tasting it at different temperature levels.",
